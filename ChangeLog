====[ Version 0.2 ]====
Complete rewrite and migration to autotools in order to fix program organisation
and incorporate new audio backends.

====[ Version 0.1 ]====

Works, somehow. HUD and fullscreen modes implemented and working, oscilloscope
and spectrum analyser modes are both functional. I'm still learning about all
the fancy GTK+3 and modern openGL things, so it's a bit of a mess. Currently it
only works with pulseaudio.
