====[ WHAT IS IT? ]====
Live audio visualiser written in C using openGL and various audio backends.
You can customise visualisations with GLSL!

====[ COMPILING/RUNNING ]====

Requires FFTW3, GTK3+ (at least 3.16) and epoxy.
Just ./configure, make, and run.
Should work to varying degrees on any platform, if you can compile it.
You'll need autotools, pkg-config and yadda yadda of course. 

If PortAudio or PulseAudio libs are found support will be compiled for them.
To disable this, use --disable-pulse or --disable-port when running configure.
You can compile without either if you feel like it. <- (not recommended)

====[ TODO ]====

-Proper saving/loading of shaders
-Access to time and a big rectangle for fragment fun
-Make it actually start even if the settings schema !exists
-Some kind of control over what vbos and uniforms are uploaded?
-Clean up the audio backend stuff 

====[ WHAT'S DONE ]====

-Working oscilloscope and spectrum modes
-Audio backends that work alright I guess
-Basic shader editing and compiling interface
