====[ WHAT IS IT? ]====
Live audio visualiser written in C using openGL and various audio backends.
You can customise visualisations easily with GLSL!


====[ COMPILING/RUNNING ]====

Requires FFTW3, GTK3+ (at least 3.16) and epoxy.
Just ./configure, make and run.
If PortAudio or PulseAudio libs are found support will be compiled for them.
To disable this, use --disable-pulse or --disable-port when running configure.


====[ TODO ]====

-Maybe just uploading the buffers and a fullscreen quad to do pixel shading
would be better
-Make HUD mode use the maximize function rather than fullscreen as fullscreen
often leads to problems on certain wms.
-Sub data more efficiently - don't upload entire array in spec if not greater than
current - instead float down. Also don't get audio until screen is ready - also
don't upload x pointlessly 
-Fix overall logical structure - clean globals, move GTK & GL to seperate files
-Make better logarithmic mode - ie figure out how to make octaves equally spaced
-Make fancy new mode optional - fix gain slider
-Selection of whether STFT window should automatically overlap?
-Spetrogram mode
-Implement commandline options for HUD mode handling
-Implement a plugins system for visualisations
-Use asynchronous pulseaudio api for all operations
-Grid mode for accurate spectrum analysis
-Preferences dialogue
	-Slider bar for logarithmic and linear amplification
	-Settings for controlling latency and zoom
-Figure out if wayland problems are synesthesia's fault or GtkGLArea's


====[ WHAT'S DONE ]====

-Basic oscilloscope and spectrum (using FFTW) modes
-GUI setup using GtkBuilders
-Fullscreen, HUD, and normal modes
